                <p>In my time as a student of the University of the Cordilleras, I have made a few Java console applications as homework. These are the ones I'm particularly proud of. These ones are well-commented, too (at least for my professor's standards).</p>

                <p>Before I began my tertiary education in the University of the Cordilleras, I was a student of the IT in Mobile App and Web Development course for Senior High at STI Baguio. I had been asked to make a few sample web-development projects in my time there. For all these projects, I can claim credit to most — if not all — of the source code.</p>

                        Okay, so this one is a bit of an exception — this isn't under any of my STI Baguio web projects, nor is this one isn't under my real name at all (thought that might change in the future as I get older), but under my internet pen-name <i>Jonathan</i>. I plan this page to be less professional and more geared towards my hobbies rather than a full portfolio page. But if you do go there, don't tell Jonathan that I sent you.

                <h2><span class="material-sym">description</span> Document Design</h2>
                <p>I've been using <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> to make stunning-looking documents and graphics for the last year. Here are some of the things I'm proudest of. Keep in mind, these were all coded using Typst and its capabilities with plugins, custom templates, and custom libraries. Do note as well that the source codes here won't work without my own custom Typst palettes and libraries, which I have sadly yet to publish (I need to finish their documentation).</p>

                    The schedule graphic I produced for my first term at the University of the Cordilleras. I'm really proud of the way I coded this — by abstracting the stuff I needed to do often, I made sure could easily produce a schedule graphic for my second term and beyond. The source code can be found <a href="./assets/13t1-sched.port.pastel.typ">here</a>.

It contains the directions to the rooms I went to for my classes, as well as the other rooms I accessed often. Source code <a href="./assets/13t1map.typ">here</a>.
