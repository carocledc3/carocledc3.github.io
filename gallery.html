                <h2>Java Applications</h2>
                <p>In my time as a student of the University of the Cordilleras, I have made a few Java console applications as homework. These are the ones I'm particularly proud of. These ones are well-commented, too (at least for my professor's standards).</p>

                        Can convert numbers of any base to any base, from bases 2 to 16 inclusive.

                        Simple application that allows entering of floating-point daily temperature data for an arbitrary number of cities, made possible by regex-powered comma separation.
                    </p></li>

                        A sample console application that uses doubly-circular linked lists to manage a sample playlist — to add, delete, and select songs within the playlist. Music not included, sadly.

                <h2>Web Experiments</h2>
                <p>Before I began my tertiary education in the University of the Cordilleras, I was a student of the IT in Mobile App and Web Development course for Senior High at STI Baguio. I had been asked to make a few sample web-development projects in my time there. For all these projects, I can claim credit to most — if not all — of the source code.</p>

                <ul>

                        Our group submission for our Web Development class, Grade 11, 2nd quarter. A sample website that introduces our group, as short-lived as said semester was. I really should've used Tailwind for this one.
                    </p></li> 

                    <li><a href="https://caro3dc.github.io/js1pt/">Squad Tritium</a><p class="itemdesc">
                        Our group submission for our jQuery/Web Development class, Grade 12, 1st quarter. Another sample introduction page, this time for a group of three.

                    <li><a href="https://caro3dc.github.io/j2pt/">Romeo's Webdev Snippets'</a><p class="itemdesc">
                        My solo submission for our jQuery/Web Development class, Grade 12, 2nd quarter. Meant to be a portal to all the activities I had submitted to that class.
                    </p></li> 

                    <li><a href="http://jonathan-iksjssen.github.io">(WIP) Pen-Name Personal Webpage</a><p class="itemdesc">
                        Okay, so this one is a bit of an exception — this isn't under any of my STI Baguio web projects, nor is this one isn't under my real name at all (thought that might change in the future as I get older), but under my internet pen-name <i>Jonathan</i>. I plan this page to be less professional and more geared towards my hobbies rather than a full portfolio page. But if you do go there, don't tell Jonathan that I sent you.
