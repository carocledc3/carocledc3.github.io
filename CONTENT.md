# ABOUT

Hi! I'm Carlos Romeo Del Castillo III â€” or just *Carlos* for short. I'm an IT student at the University of the Cordilleras, majoring in Web Technology. I've had a passion for coding dating back to my flimsy JavaScript programs six years ago. The current languages I do know how to code in are HTML and Typst for markup, CSS for stylesheeets, and JavaScript, Java, and C# for scripting.
